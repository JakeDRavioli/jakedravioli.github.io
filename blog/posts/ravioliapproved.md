(yes. seriously. this is real. we're doing this.)

I wanted to show another *cool* feature that I added. It's called, as the title implies...
## Ravioli Approved!
It's a cool way for your comment to stand out from the rest. If I deem your comment good enough, I'll give it a heart on my end - Meaning that your comment is Ravioli Approved.
It'll get a cool looking golden background and a nice golden mask icon!

Here's how the comment section on the first ["Hello, World!"](blog.html#/post/hello-world) post looks like now.

- I imagine you can see here, I also have some new icons and a unique background and gradient name. How cool is that?
Anyways, this update is small but it's still *very* noteworthy. It's like hearting your comment on YouTube, but way cooler. (Not because it's me.... I think)

This took me quite a bit seeing as I had to implement even more firebase rules to my code, at a point where my brain feels almost fried from literally doing nothing but coding all day to make this very blog you're reading.
Anyways! I'm going to sleep now. I'm writing this at nearly 2 in the morning. I haven't slept yet.

(Typically I don't, because we're all in the summer holidays right now, but I have a feeling it'll bite me in the neck in the future if I don't!)

Buh-bye, and thanks for reading!
