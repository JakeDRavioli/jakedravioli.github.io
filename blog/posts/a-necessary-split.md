Hey everyone, Jake here.

This is one of those posts I'd rather not have to write, but it's a super important one regarding the future of *Rebellious Takeover*. It's time to talk about the adult-content-shaped elephant in the room and the messy reality of trying to release an indie game with *any* kind of spice in 2025.

So, let's just get to it.

## The Problem: The internet is getting weird about adult games

If you've been following the indie scene, you've probably seen the chaos. Payment processors like PayPal and Mastercard are putting the squeeze on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, forcing them to delist games with adult or 18+ content. On top of that, here in the UK, the government is rolling out mandatory ID verification for adult sites, adding another layer of hassle.

While the ID Verification thing is, honestly in my opinion a good thing, it honestly may be a bit of a double-edged sword. You wouldn't trust a random company with your ID, right? Especially if it's something like an adult site. So respectfully, some people are a little worried.

Frankly, it's a minefield. And for a project like *Rebellious Takeover*, which was always planned to have some optional, *spicy* VN-style scenes, it puts the entire game at risk of getting nuked from orbit before it even launches.

I'm not willing to let that happen. So, I have to make a pretty drastic, and **needed** change.

## The Plan: Split it

To make sure *Rebellious Takeover* can actually be released and survive on major platforms without getting delisted if the game just looks at them wrong, **I have to split the game in two.**

Now, before you panic, let me explain what that means.

1.  **The "Safe" Base Game:** This will be the main version of the game available on Steam, Itch, or wherever else. It will have *no* explicit NSFW assets or scenes. The story, the characters, the beat-em-up combat, the swearing, the adult *references*, all that good stuff is staying. But the visually explicit content will be completely removed from this version of the game's files, including getting rid of any remotely NSFW textures on the characters, and so forth.

2.  **A "Spicy" DLC Patch:** For those who want the originally intended experience, I'll release a separate paid (or *free*, I don't know yet - This may decrease the base game price) patch file. Think of it as a downloadable DLC. You'll be able to download this from a different platform than the big platforms (I'll share details on where closer to the time, It won't be something unsafe like Discord, and more somewhere where this type of content can be distributed) and use it to add the spicy content back into the game via Unreal's patching system. This essentially "injects" the content into the game and replaces the SFW assets with the ones I use right now.

This is the best path forward. It keeps the base game clean for mainstream platforms, and allows the game to go down to **13-17+**, while still allowing people to access the content they want, without forcing it on anyone. It's much better than my original plan, which included having an option at the start of the game to enable/disable the content.

## So... What does this *actually* mean for development in the future?

A *shit-ton* of work, that's what.

From the get-go, the character rigs and textures were made with the potential for NSFW scenes in mind. To create a truly "Safe" version, I have to go back and **completely remake** all the base character textures to be non-explicit. It's a huge, tedious job that's going to take a good chunk of time over the next few months.

The core game is still the priority, and will always be, but this is a necessary, parallel task to future-proof the project.

## TL;DR: The two-version future

* **The Base Game (SFW):** Will be the standard download. It's the full story with all its vulgar language and adult themes, just with no visual nudity or explicit scenes.
* **The "Spicy bits" DLC (NSFW):** A (hopefully) **free**, separate patch you can download and apply to restore the optional adult scenes.
* **The "Why":** So the game can actually exist on platforms like Steam/Itch without getting delisted by payment processors.

This sucks, I know. It's a detour I didn't want to take, but it's the only way to protect the project long-term. Your support and understanding mean the world to me as I navigate this.

Thanks for reading, and thank you for keeping in touch with the development of Rebellious Takeover.
