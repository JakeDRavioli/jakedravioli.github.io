If you're reading this, you've probably already seen the new banner at the top of the page. If not, you might need to do a hard refresh (**CTRL + SHIFT + R**) to see it. Or, just as likely, you're already on the new site. Welcome!

So, yes, it's official: **The site is officially moving from Neocities to GitHub Pages.**

The new permanent address is: [https://jakedravioli.github.io](https://jakedravioli.github.io)

## So, why the change?

First off, I want to be clear: **Neocities is an incredible platform.** It's been the perfect host for getting this site off the ground, and I have massive respect for its mission to bring back the creative, independent web.

However, as my projects have grown, my needs have evolved. I've found myself running into a few (very respectable) limitations of the platform. My aspirations for the site, combined with my own development process, have just outgrown what Neocities was built for.

The *main* reason for the move can be boiled down to one word: **Workflow.**

Being able to use tools like **Visual Studio Code** and **GitHub Desktop** to write, edit, and push live changes *directly* is a 100x improvement for me. On Neocities, if I make a significant change, I have to wait up to an hour to get a downloadable backup. That's a platform rule I understand, but for someone making frequent, rapid updates, that delay just wasn't sustainable.

This new setup means I can update the site as easily as I update any of my other projects. It's all just one `git push` away.

## Embracing the GitHub Ecosystem

As many of you in my Discord community know, I'm already using GitHub for all my active development. All the source code and planning for **Goober Origins: Electric Gooberloo**, for instance, is managed there.

It just makes sense to consolidate. Having my project repos and my project website living in the same ecosystem is a massive organizational win. It streamlines everything and feels like the right fit for the kind of developer-focused work I'm doing.

There's also a secondary reason: future-proofing. With new legislation like the **Online Safety Act**, there's a lot of uncertainty for smaller, independent hosts. I'd reached out to Neocities months ago about it but haven't seen any new policies that would clarify the situation for creators.

Given that my site hosts content that *could* be considered "adult," I've been left in the dark about whether my work is at risk of being removed.

Ultimately, I had to bite the bullet and move to a platform where I have more direct control and stability. This move to GitHub Pages is a proactive step to make sure the site remains stable and accessible for a long time to come.

## What this means for you

Not a whole lot, really! It just means you'll need to **update your bookmarks.**

The Neocities site will stay online for a while as an archive (and to host this message), but **all new blog posts, portfolio updates, and project news will be posted *only* on the new GitHub Pages site.**

The new site is a carbon copy of this one, so everything should feel exactly the same.

Anyway, that's the update. Thanks for following along, and I'll see you over at the new place.

Cheers,
