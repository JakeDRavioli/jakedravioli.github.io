> *How a cocky catboy and his cohorts* in a *cybercity* doomed by *corporate menaces* came to be.

---


Hey - Jake once more, back again this time to explain some things relating to my main passion project, and, truthfully, actually explain *why* the heck this game exists, and why it ended up being called "Rebellious Takeover."

If you've checked out the [Rebellious Takeover landing page](rebellioustakeover.html) (seriously, go do that if you haven't - I *cooked so hard* with it), you probably already know this:

> "In the sprawling city of Nexon, a corporate giant's greed is about to meet its match."

Imagine this: a city drowning in neon lights and corporate logos. That's **Nexon** - a fully corporatised cyber-city powered by a strange mineral called **Vithium**. It's shiny, it's powerful, and it's basically the equivalent of the big and evil power generators of today, just... in mineral form. Shiny rock that makes power. Kinda like [The Crystal from Pressure](https://pressure.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crystal) (amazing game, by the way).

At its core - pun fully intended - this project started because I didn't want my original characters (OCs) to just sit in folders gathering dust.
I wanted them to *exist* somewhere, to live and breathe in a world that felt uniquely theirs. And so, what started as scattered ideas, sketches, and "what-if" scenarios turned into something way bigger: a game, built in Unreal Engine 5, called **Rebellious Takeover**.

But let me roll back the clock a bit and give you the story behind the story.

## A little bit of chaos in that noggin of mine

---

I've always been obsessed with the idea of rebellion - *not* the throw-a-brick kind (usually), but the creative kind. Questioning what “normal” means. Making something different, and flying in the face of what most people would define as *normalcy*, just because... Why not? lol

Combine that with my love for beat-em-ups (Zenless Zone Zero, Hi-Fi Rush), visual novels (*Class Of '09*, *Doki Doki Literature Club!*, *Missed Messages*, and some more questionable examples like the *NEKOPARA* series... *despite* it's DLC being... ahem. Weird...), and worlds that feel alive, and characters moreso - and you get Rebellious Takeover.

Before this was ever going to be a game, it was just a personal lore project - a place to give my OCs purpose after moving on from Roblox and into tools like Blender and Unreal.  
The plan? Tell a story that's messy, funny, heartfelt, and a bit unhinged. One where the characters feel alive because... well, they kinda are to me. I reflect my own personality on them in some way - Whether it's "I really want to portray it, but am too socially anxious to do so", "I want to but I physically cannot", or just because each character is in it's own way, a little sectioned bit of my brain in some form. Like emotions that I portray, just prioritizing those specific personalities bound to those emotions.

We've got:  
- Corporate sabotage
- Roommate shenanigans
- **FOUR** chaotic couples trying to stay alive *and* stay together
- And a city that feels just a little too real in today's world - Whether we like it or not.

It's truly a love letter to the stories I've always wanted to tell, wrapped in beat-em-up combat and visual novel choices.

## The name that wouldn't go away

---

So... why *Rebellious Takeover*? That's what you all came here for, right? Why I went with that name?

Truth be told, it's **stupidly simple**. It's because it describes *exactly* what the story is about:  
A bunch of scrappy rebels fighting to take back what's rightfully theirs from a mega-corp that's basically Apple, Google, Meta, Tesla, and your local supermarket all merged into one dystopian nightmare - **Veritas Industries**.

It's literally a rebellious takeover. Citizens taking back their free will. It's almost poetic.
Plus, it just sounds kinda cool, y'know?

## A heart worth stealing

---

At the centre of all this chaos is **Deren** - the team's overconfident tactician and the creator of the **C.O.R.E**: a powerful, Vithium-powered heart replacement.  
He literally built himself a mechanical heart before Vithium was even considered valuable. Years later, Veritas finds the old blueprints in an abandoned hideout of his and starts selling it as the next big thing.

Imagine sitting on your sofa and seeing an advert for your *own heart* being sold by the evil corp you despise. That's how Deren got his motive. Before that, he ran a store called Subroutine - A simple repair shop in Nexon, which he now uses sneakily as a hideout for the team.

So he bands up with friends, slowly but surely:  
- Phenn, the quiet strategist
- Ral & Cel, the chaos duo
- Lyra, the half-feral hacker sniping from her window
- And yes... if we must - my self-insert OC, Jayce. Calm on the outside, panicking on the inside. *(We all need representation, okay? Please don't hate me for putting a version of myself in here...)*

Together, they plan to take Veritas down and bring some normalcy back to Nexon.  
The heart of the story (haha) is about fighting back, sticking together, and refusing to let corporations walk all over what makes you, *you*.

## From concept and onwards

---

I will once again say, you can *always* check out the [landing page](rebellioustakeover.html) for more info - it's always updating, just like the project itself.  
And yeah, the name "Rebellious Takeover" might be simple, but it captures everything: a fight against power, a literal takeover, and a refusal to stay quiet.

Okay, In... Out. Nice and easy.

That's why it's called what it is, and why it exists at all.  
Thanks for reading - and trust me, this is only the beginning.

**- Jake**
