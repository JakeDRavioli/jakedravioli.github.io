## TL;DR

After 6+ years of development on Roblox, I'm officially stepping down from Dev4Fun Studios and leaving the platform entirely.

I've grown disillusioned with Roblox due to its direction - from spotlighting "soft-condo" games and questionable figures, to corporate nonsense and a lack of care for genuine creators. It's no longer a space I feel safe or passionate creating in.

**Dev4Fun isn't ending**  -  Kas and the rest of the team are taking over and continuing work on *Revolture's Trigger* without me. I'm stepping away, but the game and studio live on.

Meanwhile, I'm moving full-time into Unreal Engine 5 development, and focusing all my energy on a new game called **Rebellious Takeover**, which captures the same chaotic, story-driven spirit in a brand-new way.

Hey everyone, Jake here.

This is a different kind of post - one that's been sitting heavy on my mind for a long, long time. After years of pouring my creativity, time, and energy into building experiences on Roblox, after around *6+ years* developing on the platform, I'm officially announcing that I'm stepping down from my position at **Dev4Fun Studios** and walking away from the Roblox platform entirely.

I know this might not be a total shock to some - especially if you remember my announcement back in 2024, when I started to slowly step back. But I still feel like I owe you all an honest explanation for why this decision has become *final*.

## Why I'm Leaving

My journey as a developer has taken me somewhere new. Since starting my Games Design course, I've been working in **Unreal Engine 5** - and honestly? I've genuinely came to like it more. The tools, the freedom, the *possibility*â€¦ it all lit a fire in me that I haven't felt in years. Roblox just doesn't hit the same anymore. *At all*.

But that's only part of the reason.

The truth is, I've become deeply disillusioned with Roblox as a platform. Over the past year, it's felt less like a space for creative freedom, and more like a platform that actively ignores its developers - unless they're part of the problem.

They've also corporatized the entire site. You want games? No. Experiences. The games page? You mean the charts? Friends? What are those, I only know *Connections*.
***Who the fuck chose these names???***
Like seriously! Who???
And then David Baszucki himself, is actively trying to **ALLOW DATING** FOR AGE-VERIFIED USERS??? LIKE, WHAT THE FUCK- ***HAS THIS WEBSITE GONE FUCKING INSANE?!?***

Getting back on topic, watching "soft-condo" games (yes, *those* ones, I'm looking at you, *TheOfficiaITeddy*) rise into the spotlight - in *official* events like "The Hunt", no less - while actual creators that deserve a spot get sidelined? It's disgusting. Roblox is supposed to be for everyone, especially kids. But when bad actors get rewarded and real developers get buried, it's hard not to feel betrayed. And don't get me started on how many people are being outed as **pedophiles** left, right and centre on the platform. You cannot, and I repeat, **CANNOT** go one day without a controversy starting.

You start asking yourself why you're even still here - and for me, that question was answered a **LONG** time ago.

## The Future of Dev4Fun & Revolture's Trigger

Let me make this very clear:

This is **not** the end of Dev4Fun.  
This is **not** the end of *Revolture's Trigger*.

This post isn't about disbanding or cancelling anything. It's about **passing the torch**.

I've handed over the reins of Dev4Fun Studios to people I trust with everything we've built. **Kas** and the rest of the team now hold the keys, and I couldn't ask for better hands to guide the project. The vision remains the same. The creativity is still alive. The game lives on.

More developers are coming aboard. The project is still evolving. It's just no longer my wheelhouse - and I'm okay with that.

I'll still remain listed as the "Founder" of Dev4Fun, but realistically, I won't be helping out anymore. I don't even want to log in to Roblox at this point. It's heart-breaking to say, but it's the truth. The platform has become a shell of what it once was - suffocating under its own moderation nightmares and misplaced priorities.

They're digging their own grave. I just don't want to be buried with them.

## What's Next For Me?

If you liked the unique blend of story-driven chaos, 3D beat-'em-up combat, and platforming that *Revolture's Trigger* brought to the table - then good news: I'm not done creating.

I'm building something new.  
Something *bigger*.  
Something *real*.

It's called **Rebellious Takeover** - a full-scale game being developed entirely in **Unreal Engine 5**. It's a love letter to everything I've ever wanted to make: intense action, dark humour, deep character writing, and a world you can truly get lost in. Think chaos, corporate espionage, underground resistance vibes - *and* none of it censored by an AI moderation system that cries when I upload a slightly off-color .jpg.

UE5 lets me *paint* what I want - without feeling like I'm creating under surveillance. And that? That's freeing.

To everyone who's supported meâ€¦  
To those who played my games, gave feedback, stayed hyped, or even just lurked in the communityâ€¦

**Thank you.** From the bottom of my heart.

Dev4Fun shaped me.  
This community built me.  
But my time as a Roblox developer ends today.

It's been real. It's been chaotic.  
And yeah...
It's been fun. ðŸ«¡

**- Jake**
