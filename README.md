## About This Project

This site serves as my central hub on the web. It's where I showcase my game development projects, host my personal blog, and share information about my original characters and stories, most notably *Rebellious Takeover*.

This repository is the live, current version of the site, having been migrated from its original home on Neocities.

## Features

This isn't just a static page! It's a hand-coded, feature-rich site that includes:

* **Dynamic Theme Switcher:** A robust, JavaScript-powered theme modal that lets users choose from over a dozen different themes (including seasonal ones).
* **Seasonal Effects:** An optional particle system for seasonal themes (like falling snow for Christmas or leaves for Autumn) that can be toggled by the user.
* **Markdown Blog:** A fully custom-built blog system that dynamically fetches and parses Markdown files (`.md`) into HTML for easy posting.
* **Project Portfolio:** A dedicated section to showcase my work in game design and 3D art.
* **Modular HTML:** The site is built using modular `header.html` files that are injected into pages via JavaScript, making site-wide updates (like the recent move-announcement banner) simple to implement.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with heavy use of CSS variables for theming)
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: All interactivity, including the theme switcher, modals, and blog parser, is written in plain, dependency-free JavaScript.

## Repository Purpose

This repository was originally created as a backup of my Neocities website. As of October 2025, it has become the **primary production repository** for the site.

The move to GitHub Pages was made to:
1.  **Improve workflow** by allowing direct updates via `git push` from VS Code and GitHub Desktop.
2.  **Integrate** my website with the same ecosystem where my other projects (like *Goober Origins: Electric Gooberloo*) are already hosted.
3.  **Gain more control** over the site's hosting and future stability.
