> "Rebellious Takeover finally looks... *Rebellious*."

Hey everyone, Jake here once more! Two posts in a day. Crazy, right?

So, you know that [Rebellious Takeover landing page](rebellioustakeover.html) I've been linking to throughout the majority of these posts? Well, I decided it was time to give it a complete, top-to-bottom overhaul to properly match the game's stylized, rebellious vibe.

And now, it's finally live for you all to check out.

## What's New? (besides... you know. *Everything?*)

Instead of a simple info dump, the new page is a dynamic, animated hub for all things *Rebellious Takeover*. I'm genuinely so proud of how this turned out. It feels less like a webpage and more like an actual piece you'd see within the game itself.

Here are some of the highlights:

* **A Dynamic Parallax Banner:** The top of the page now features a massive, multi-layered banner with the main cast, logo, and background all moving and floating independently. It feels *so much more* alive now.
* **Interactive Character Dossiers:** I've scrapped the old static character list. Now, you can browse through interactive dossiers for both the protagonists and the antagonists, styled to look like you're browsing through leaked files.
* **Intel, Caches & More:** There are new sections for world lore (like Vithium and Veritas Industries), a breakdown of the core gameplay, and even a "Data Cache" to house concept art and footage for the future - Which will be *forever* updating!

Basically, it's the "non-stop-shop" for information I've always wanted it to be. I poured a ton of work into this, and it really feels like it's finally doing the project justice.

Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments!

Thanks for following the journey. Having a central hub like this that I'm actually proud of is a huge milestone. Now, back to actually *making* the game, lol

Thanks for reading! Cheers!
