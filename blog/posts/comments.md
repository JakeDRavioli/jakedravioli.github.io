Hey everyone, JakeDRavioli again - Just here to mention a new update to the blog. Comments!
If you take a look *below* this post, there's a comment section! How nice is that?
You can comment to tell me how you feel or to put your *own* opinion in.

Though I do have to note this.
## Please be respectful down there.
I am giving you guys the power of comments, so please, be respectful with it or the feature may be disabled in the future.
This was all coded manually - I suffer for you guys' accessability to be able to talk between one another and to me. This took forever to do, and I'm very proud of how it turned out.

I've recently changed how some things work. Names are limited to numbers and letters to stop people from adding emojis to names - and I also added some protections to make sure that the name is not the same as the content of the comment to make sure that the name and content are not the same.
By default, the name you're given is "Guest-[Anonymous User ID]". You're free to change that to whatever username you want, but it's there as a default for those who wish to stay anonymous when commenting.

I've also integrated a new feature for community comments I like - Ravioli Approved! You can find more about this on [the blog post I made for it](blog.html#/post/ravioliapproved)!

## Edit 2: 5:30PM, Sat 12th July 2025
I've now added *Google Login* to the comment section! Log in with your Google account to get saved likes across browsers and use your Google Username by default when commenting.

## If it doesn't appear for you, do a hard refresh.
## On Desktop, press ***CTRL + SHIFT + R*** to refresh and reload any cached assets. This should update your javascript to be the version from the serverside.


Thank you once more, and once again - More posts coming soon. Cya!
