Hey everyone, JakeDRavioli here - Or Jake, JDR, whichever name you want to call me. I figured it was about time I set up a proper place to post updates, dev logs, life stuff, tips and tricks and whatever else is on my mind.
### and trust me, there's a lot in that little noggin of mine.

For those who don't know me, I'm a games design student based in the UK. My passion is creating stories that stick and games that stick even more. It's a long road (seriously LOL), but this blog is going to be a big part of that journey.

## What I do
I've got my hands in a lot of areas. I'm trying to build a versatile skillset so I can bring my ideas to life, as you may have seen. Here's a quick rundown of the main tools I'm working with right now:

* **Game Engines:** Unity (*sometimes*) & Unreal Engine 5
* **Previous game engines:** Roblox (though, I recently left the platform back in Febuary)
* **3D Art:** Blender & VRoid Studio
* **2D Art:** Krita & Paint.NET
* **Programming/Web:** LUA, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blueprinting (UE5)

> My goal is to blend all these skills together to create some really unique experiences. I'm especially excited to share progress on my main project, *Rebellious Takeover*, funnily enough, right here on this blog. You can find more about this game at it's main page on this neocities site [here](rebellioustakeover.html)!

## Why a blog?
Honestly, I just felt that a blog was something that I genuinely think might work. I've set it up so it uses purely **Markdown**, so it's very easy for me to edit! I've even added a liking system that uses firebase, and I'm *honestly* pretty damn proud of it.
This blog is a new venture for me, so thanks for stopping by. The best way to keep up with what I'm doing is to join the community.

You can find me and *other* cool people on my [Personal Discord Server](https://discord.gg/B3CyG6F8x7). Feel free to pop in and say hi! (*The server is a mostly adult environment, so I'd be warned when joining.*)

## Edit - 11:56 PM, Friday 11th July 2025
I released comments! You can check the blog post related to that [here](blog.html#/post/comments). :D


That's all for now. Expect more posts soon! <3
