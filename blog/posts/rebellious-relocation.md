Hey everyone, Jake here with a quick bit of housekeeping.

If you've popped onto the main blog page recently looking for updates on *Rebellious Takeover* and found... well, *nothing*, please don't panic! No, *Veritas Industries* didn't issue a cease and desist, and I haven't rage-deleted everything in a fit of Unreal Engine-induced psychosis. Deren and the Subroutine team have *not* decided to go totally anonymous, I promise.

### *(i don't think someone like Lyra would keep a promise if she was hosting this blog...)*

The real reason is that things were starting to get a little crowded on the main feed. It felt weird having a super-serious post about the game's future sitting right next to me rambling about my new PC case... It just felt a little... wrong. I figured it was time to do some digital spring cleaning.

To make things easier for everyone to find, I've given *Rebellious Takeover* its very own dedicated section on the blog! It's got the whole theme to match the [landing page](rebellioustakeover.html) and I'm honestly super proud of how it turned out.

Seriously, take a look for yourself (click the blurred image to reveal!):

All the devlogs, character updates, and future ramblings about the game will live there from now on. You can find the new, themed-out section by clicking the big ol' link below:

The main blog will still be for everything else. General life updates, things that I just wanna yap about, and whatever other nonsense pops into my noggin.

*Also*, for those who want quick access, you don't have to come back to this post every time. There's now a link right below the blog header to jump to and from the Rebellious Takeover Devblog. Hope that helps!

That's all for now. Thanks for reading!
