Hey everyone, Jake here.

You know how it is. You spot one tiny little thing that's broken on your website. "An easy fix," you whisper to yourself, naively. Next thing you know, it's 4 AM, you've rewritten the entire site's foundation, implemented features you never planned, and your browser has more tabs open than a detective's corkboard.

That's basically been my life for the past few days. I went down the rabbit hole of site updates, and now I've emerged, blinking in the sunlight, to show you all the cool new stuff I broke and then fixed. So, let's get into it.

## My CSS Had a Mid-Life Crisis (And Came Out Better for It)

First things first, I fixed a *ton* of broken CSS that was making the site look janky. But why stop at just *fixing* things? I decided to go all-in and convert my entire stylesheet over to use **CSS Attributes**.

In human terms? It means I can now create themes for the site with way less hassle. It's cleaner, it's more efficient, and it's the perfect foundation for the next big thing...

## Welcome to the Theme Park (haha)

That's right, you can now change the entire look of the site on the fly. I've added a full-blown theming system with a bunch of options to suit your vibe. Whether you're a dark mode purist or a synthwave junkie, or just... *hate your eyes* and wanna go cursed, I've got you covered.

Here's the current lineup:
-   **Default Dark:** The classic, easy-on-the-eyes experience.
-   **Pristine Light:** For those who aren't afraid of the light. *You monsters...*
-   **Synthwave:** Neon-drenched, retro-futuristic goodness.
-   **Terminal:** For the inner hacker in all of us. Green text on a black screen. **Has Lyra as a profile picture!**
-   **Midnight:** A deeper, darker... *dark* mode. **Has Deren as a profile picture!**
-   **Navy & Gold:** A bit of a classier, more sophisticated look.
-   **Legacy (Original):** For the good ol' days when the site looked... well, like it used to. **This attempts to bring back the old header, just in case you don't like the new one**.
-   **CURSED:** I. Am not. Sorry. You have been warned. That's all I'm saying.
-   **And Seasonal Themes!** Halloween, Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and Autumn themes that will pop up automatically throughout the year (complete with special effects like falling snow!).

At the time of writing, the theme is set to **Autumn**, so you'll be seeing a lot of yellows and oranges - AND you'll likely also be seeing leaves fall across the blog post! Those can be changed, and the seasonal effects can be disabled in the theme picker on the header.

## A Whole New Page of Secrets

This is the big one. I've added a brand new **"Extras"** page, which is basically a data dump of lore, chaos, and secrets from the world of *Rebellious Takeover*. Think of it as a folder of files you were never meant to see.

You can navigate through a bunch of different tabs, including:
-   **ricksjunk.biz:** A look at the beautifully terrible personal business page of a Veritas subordinate. Akin to the *Cursed* theme, just as *another* warning to you. ***Please.***
-   **mixtapes.zip:** Character-specific, 15-song long Spotify playlists that Lyra "curated" by hacking into everyone's accounts. If you wanna get into a character's headspace, this is the way to!
-   **ama_archive.docx:** A transcript of an internal Q&A session with some... *revealing*... answers.
-   **deren_notes.log:** Fragments from Deren's tech logs. Simple-as.
-   **wishlist.dat:** The official Subroutine hideout shopping list. Updates occasionally. You should check in every so often.
-   **totally-real-live-ama.ps1:** A new interactive feature (...it's barely interactive) where you can "ping" a character with a question and get a (probably unhelpful) response. Rebellious Takeover's 8-ball.

It's a huge lore drop and a ton of fun, so go dig around.

## Quality-of-Life & The Little Things

Alongside the big stuff, I made a bunch of smaller tweaks that should make everything feel way better to use.

The header at the top of the page got a facelift, and I've added a **hamburger menu** so you can actually find all the pages now. The mobile experience in general is just *so much better*.

Oh, and check out my profile picture on the [homepage](index.html).
-   In some themes, the picture itself will change to match the vibe (like I mentioned in the themes section!)
-   The hover text is massively improved, and you can now just **click or tap the image** to show the text, which means mobile users can finally see my dumb jokes. You're welcome.

And that's most of it! I also squashed countless bugs and optimized a bunch of stuff behind the scenes. The whole site should feel a lot more alive and polished now. Go play with the new themes, check out the extras page, and let me know what you think.

Cheers!
