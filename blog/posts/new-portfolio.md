Hey everyone, Jake here.

I've been doing a lot of housekeeping on the site recently, from moving the *Rebellious Takeover* devlogs to their own section to overhauling the landing page. Today, I'm adding another big piece to the puzzle: a *proper* portfolio page!

(about time... seeing as the page was empty since May... ANYWAYSSSS)

For a while now, my old "Projects" page didn't really get much love. It shown all of my projects, but yet it barely looks like I tried compared to the rest of the site. So, I decided to remake it to be more up-to-date.

It's a one-stop shop to see the full timeline of my journey as a developer. From the oldest things like *Derpz Fightin' Grounds* still being a prominent feature on the page, to what I'm currently wrestling with in Unreal Engine 5.

## What's in the box?

The new page is split into a few sections to make it easy to browse:

* **Personal & Solo Projects:** This is the main event, featuring everything from my current flagship project, [*Rebellious Takeover*](rebellioustakeover.html), to my college projects (which are new! Most people haven't seen these!) and the legacy of games like *Revolture's Trigger* and *Derpz Fightin' Grounds*, like I mentioned before.
* **Collaborations & Contributions:** This is mostly the same - A showcase of games where I played a major role, like helping rework the horror game *CHAIN* or contributing to the rhythm game *Starlight Funk*.
* **Other Skills & Ventures:** This covers everything else, like the development groups I've founded (a new one being *vecShift Studios*), my YouTube channel, and there's even some lore about this *very* website.

It's got a little bit of everything and gives a much better picture of the skills I've been building over the years. I'm pretty excited with how it turned out, and it feels good to have a centralized place to point people to when I say "Oh, I have the skills". It's... up to them if they believe me or not - BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT - I can shove this in their face and say "Hey! I've got a lot under my hat! Check it!"

Go have a look for yourself. You may even find a free game in there. ðŸ‘€

As always, thanks for keeping up with everything I'm doing. It means a lot.

Now, back to doing... something productive, I hope. Cya!
