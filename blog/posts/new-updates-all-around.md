Hey everyone, Jake here, back once more with another hefty site-wide update. You know that feeling when you start by fixing one tiny CSS bug and end up accidentally rewriting half the website? Yeah, that was my last week. But hey, the good news is my descent into madness has produced some genuinely cool new features for you all.

I've tinkered with pretty much everything. The main homepage, this very blog, the *Rebellious Takeover* landing page, and even what happens when you get hopelessly lost. I've officially remade the entire website to be more close to my new theming. *New academic year, new me, I guess?*

So, grab a drink, settle in, and let me walk you through the chaos.

## This Blog Just Got a Serious Glow-Up

I've added a bunch of quality-of-life features to the blog itself, because scrolling through my unhinged ramblings should at least be a *premium* experience, right?

* **A Freaking Search Bar!**
    That's right, you can now search for posts! No more endlessly scrolling to find that one specific article where I complained about *shaders*, or complain about *computers*... *I complain about a lot, don't I?*
 AAAAaaanyways... Just type in a keyword and let the JavaScript magic do the work. Revolutionary, I know.

* **"How Long Is This Gonna Take?" - Read Times!**
    Ever click on a post and wonder if you're committing to a two-minute skim or a ten-minute deep-dive? Wonder no more. Every post preview now has an estimated reading time, so you know exactly what you're getting into. *Cannot say if it's true or not though*. Depends on if I dawdle on like I am right now. hehe.

* **The "You Might Also Like..." Section**
    At the bottom of each post, you'll now find a section for related articles. It uses a super-advanced AI that has half-sentience and- ok who am i kidding it's just some simple tag-searching logic LOL
     Anyways, it finds posts you might enjoy. And if it can't find anything related? It panics and throws three completely random posts at you. It's not a bug, it's a *feature*. A "serendipitous discovery" feature.
     Don't ask me if I know what that word means. I'll probably get back to you in 5 business days. And still won't know. Just google it man.

* **The Mighty "Back to Top" Button**
    For those extra-long posts (like this one, *probably*) or when you get lost in the comment section abyss, there's now a handy little button in the corner to send you straight back to the top. *Your scroll wheel finger can thank me later.*

On top of all that, I've done a bunch of other little tweaks and optimizations behind the scenes to make things run a bit smoother, including optimizing files and compressing PNGs that maybe don't need to be *like, 4,000 pixels in size*. The whole place should feel a little zippier now.

## The Homepage got an overhaul!

My [main home page](index.html) has been given a wild upgrade. It's gone from a sad, lonely business card that... well, it honestly *disappointed* employers rather than *enticed them*, to a proper digital living room. It's got links to my socials, a new "neighbors" section to shout out other cool sites, and even a direct portal to this very blog.

I even added a little HTML snippet so you can slap an official "jake discombobulated ravioli" button on your own site, if you're into that. Go on, you know you want to. I might even make it appear on my own site too! Free traffic for the both of us. Hoorah!

## Rebellious Takeover Updates: Chibis & Chaos

The game-related pages also got some love, because *of course they did.*

### New Chibi Subroutine Rebels Have Deployed!

The main [Rebellious Takeover landing page](rebellioustakeover.html) has been graced by the presence of four new, adorable, and slightly-gremlin-like chibi avatars for **Deren, Ral, Lyra, and Phenn**! Take a look at how they look here.

![they're actually so cute oh mah gah :O](/Images/blog/newchibisohmahgah.png#spoiler)

This absolutely incredible art was done by the talented **glaciercyforce/Gar**. They completely nailed the vibe, and I couldn't be happier. If you need some amazing art done, seriously, go check out their work and commission them. They deserve it.

### Getting Lost Is Now a Lore-Accurate Experience

I finally made a proper 404 "Not Found" page. But instead of a boring old error message, you get heckled by the cast of *Rebellious Takeover*.

Each time you hit a dead link, you'll enter a terminal-like page where it attempts to enter the page you were trying to reach, and *fails*. one of the characters will then pop up with one of their canonical usernames (`retri_ii`, `DerpzDeNugget` (*if you know, you know*), `jaytracee`, etc.) and a unique, in-character message telling you how badly you screwed up. Will you get Lyra telling you it's a "skill issue"? Or Ral admitting she probably put a digital landmine there purposefully? It's a surprise every time! It's the most fun you'll ever have being... *completely lost.*

And that's pretty much everything! It was a ton of work, but the site feels so much more alive and functional now. Go click around, try out the search, get lost on purpose, and let me know what you think in the comments.

Thanks for sticking with me through the madness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go touch some grass before I *forget what the sun looks like.*

Cya!
