Heya! Jake again. It's been a while since my last post - So what's better than to start the weekend with some life updates? Today, we're taking a little break from the usual game dev chaos to talk about something equally important: the holy ritual of a PC upgrade. My machine was basically begging for a new casing over it's 4 years of use - So I decided it was better off with some much needed upgrades.

Fair warning though, this gets quite interesting.

## The Problem: *Corsair*, *Overclockers UK* & my *16-year-old, "i-know-it-all" ass negligence*... fucked up a *really good build*.

- **...For the time.**

My old setup was... fine. It worked. But "fine" doesn't cut it when you're [compiling shaders in Unreal Engine 5](blog.html#/post/skin-clipping) and your CPU temperatures start looking like a weather forecast for the sun. I got this PC back when I was 16 and at that time, I thought I *needed* one, getting into a Level 2 Games Design course at an undisclosed college nearby me. So, I spent a whopping ***Â£1,500*** at *Overclockers UK* to get myself the sweet upgrade I needed. I originally ran on a Ryzen 5 1600X, and a Geforce GTX 970. Kinda shitty, even for the time, but it was all I was able to get until then. With money in hand, I bought what I thought were a good pick. Little did I know I fucked up so royally and I would never know until near the end of it's warranty.

I went for all looks, no actual performance. I bought a **Corsair 280X Micro-ATX Case**. It had amazing looks, it had amazing RGB, it...

It was a shitbox. All looks, no actual airflow. It heated up like anything. Here's what it looked like.

And then? Oh, I just had to get the best of the best CPU cooler, right?

Nope. Jonsbo Profile CPU cooler. I don't even know what Jonsbo is. Why it was selected is beyond me - But it *royally* fucked the airflow in this case. It faced towards the glass. Why? Yes.

Here's what *that* looks like.

So with that combo, alongside a Ryzen 5 3600 that Overclockers... *naturally*, overclocked to ***4.2GHz***, An RTX 3060 TI, and a ASUS Prime motherboard...

...Yeah. It uh... It heated up. A lot.

That case and CPU cooler combo was the reason for nearly 4 years I lost hundreds of gaming sessions, work, and so on. I'm glad I didn't corrupt my installation of Windows at all during that time. Somehow.

So... With that out of the way, it was *dead obvious* what my mission for this was.


It was time for a change before my PC achieved nuclear fission. I was tired of my room doubling as a sauna every time I wanted to, y'know, *work*. (Especially so during the summer heatwave here in the UK. I wish I was *elsewhere*, gonna be real.)

## The Solution: Airflow, *Airflow*, and ***maybe***... a little bit of coolness.

After way too much time spent scrolling through reviews and all kinds of stuff, talking with my much more computer-centric friends, and mentally measuring my desk space (or... lack there of, being that my desk is literally the roof of my house's stairwell), I pulled the trigger on two **key** upgrades:

* **Case:** [LianLi Lancool 207 (In white!)](https://lian-li.com/product/lancool-207/)
* **CPU Cooler:** [Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE (*also* in white!)](https://computerorbit.com/collections/thermalright-peerless-assassin/products/thermalright-peerless-assassin-120-se-white-a-rgb-dual-tower-air-cooler)

The goal was simple: better temps, better airflow, and let's be real, it had to *look* cool. My last case was intended for the whole "Light up my whole room" type of shit, so I had to follow suit with a more airflow-oriented upgrade that still nailed in the coffin of "*alternative room light source*". The Lancool is a *beast* for airflow, and the Peerless Assassin is just *legendary* for its performance-to-price ratio. It's the hero I needed when my budget was less than Â£200.

Eventually, it arrived this Thursday, and I got some of my friends to come over and help me case swap. And so, the chaos began.

## The "Oh God, Please Don't Break" Part

Swapping PC components is always a fun mix of excitement and sheer terror. Will it post? Did I forget a cable? Did I just brick my entire livelihood? You know, the usual Tuesday - or in my case, Thursday - anxiety.

It took three of us a total of ***four hours*** to get this done. ***Four***. That's quite a bit... at least for me.

Thankfully, after the transplant was complete, it booted up without a fuss. After I got it up on my desk, The difference was *instant*. My idle temps seemed to of dropped SIGNIFICANTLY, and under load, it's a whole new world. No more risk of me accidentally surging to over **90** degrees all because I loaded up a game at medium settings (Like for example, it *totally* screwed me over playing Watch Dogs 2 before. And that was in Winter!!!)

It's beautiful. Almost poetic in a way.

## Before & After

Words are great, but pictures are better. I didn't take a "before" shot because, let's be real - I wanted to get this out of the way more than anything - But here's the glorious "after".

> Excuse how messy it may look. I tried cleaning up before I took this shot, but... I will say it isn't the best.

![The final build, all clean and running cool. A thing of beauty.](/Images/blog/pc-upgrade/final_build.jpg#spoiler)

*Look at it. It's genuinely incredible.* While it does make the actual *mobo* look tiny, Truth be told, there's a hell of a lot more *white* in this case compared to the old one. Especially thanks to that *beheamoth* of a CPU cooler.

## Final Thoughts

Was it worth the stress and the cost? Honestly, abso-*fucking*-lutely. If your PC is struggling to keep its cool, a case and cooler upgrade is one of the best things you can do. It's not as flashy as a new GPU (and truth be told - *i ain't got the budget for that LOL*), but it makes everything run smoother, and also tags itself in as a free *room cooler*. Yeah. Seriously. It actually cools my room down now. That's a monumental step from the sweating I used to endure with the old case being near me.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go stare at my new setup for an unhealthy amount of time. Probably with the Aura Sync *Music* modifier on. I for some reason love looking at static things react to music.

Until next time, folks. Have a nice rest of your weekend.

**- Jake**
